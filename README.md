# LFGUtils
Command-line utilities to create and expand old LucasFilm Game (LFG) archives.  These archive files had extensions like .XXX, .ND3, .ND4, and .MI2 and were used in 1992-era LucasFilm PC games that came on disk but needed to be installed to a hard drive.

LFGDump - Extract from archive. 

LFGMake - Create archive.

Project files included for Xcode and Borland C++ v3.1!
